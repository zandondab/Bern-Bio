		<p> 	Growing up in a very remote rural village in Zimbabwe, I did not have access to any form of technology apart from a small FM radio set that we owned as a family. <br>
			I was first introduced to technology when I went to Secondary school and enrolled into a Computing course. The classes and exposure that I had about computer systems <br> ignited a passion inside me about technology. I instantly knew that I was going to have a career in the tech world, <br> and began to research more about how I would eventually launch a career in the tech field.<br>
			Moving on, I began to just strongly believe in the power that Computer Systems have to transform our world for the better, and I just wanted to be a part of that force.</P>
		<p>     In August 2019, I started college as an IT major at Saint Augustine's University here in Raleigh, NC. I wanted computer science so that I would dive more into software<br> programing, but my school did not have that, so I was left with only the option of IT. During my sophomore year, I was able secure an internship with <br> Dude Solutions during the fall semester and then another one with lenovo
			during the summer. Although these internships were not directly related to IT <br> they allowed me to get the exposure that I needed from the corporate world and also adding that weight on my resume that I badly needed to get the attention of other companies. <br> Fortunately, everything worked as I had envisioned because I recently got an internship as a Technology Analyst with Credit Suisse. It is everything I ever wanted!<br>
